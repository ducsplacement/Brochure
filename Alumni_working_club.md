Student Community is believed to be incomplete, without the support and encouragement of its alumni. Considering the significance of such a club, DUCS dedicatedly functions to create and maintain a life-long connection between the Institute and its alumni. The Department is proud to have an Alumni Circle amongst whom are those placed in the worldâ€™s most prestigious companies like Amazon, Adobe, Morgan Stanley etc. And some of the distinguished alumni are the founders of the extremely successful Delhi-based start-ups Velmenni and JMoon Technologies. A Major task that needs to be carried out every year is blending the new generations into the old ones. Hence, at the beginning of each academic year, a Skit is organized for introducing the new students to their alumni. Besides Skit , events like freshers(Parichay), seminars, workshops, Sankalan-our technical fest serves as the platform of connectivity. Our Alumni contribute by providing the present generation with immense experience and guidance through the placement sessions. They take out time to prepare the students for the grueling placement sessions with study sessions, pep talks, behavioural tips, and give them insights about the working of the industry.
