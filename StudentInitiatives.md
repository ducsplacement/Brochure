## Student Initiatives

Srijan : The Student Magazine 

“Srijan” as the name suggest; is the creation of a doorway letting everyone express views on a wide array of technical as well as non-technical topics. The magazine encourages students to think beyond the pages of the textbook and brings out their creative side.


Student Orientation : The Welcome and The GoodBye ! 

Amidst a plethora of projects & assignments we do ensure to have a break for celebrating and interacting with each other. Besides the day to day, luncheons, birthday celebrations; DUCS has a culture of celebrating these three fun get-togethers :

Orientation : The Department teachers and students organize an orientation on the first day of the academic year, to enlighten the new students about the rules and regulations of the department. The orientation ensures that the best of knowledge is provided to all students to carry out their life at the department with ease.

Skit and Freshers: The skit is a welcoming fun event to carve out the actor within each one of us. This event fills the air with humor, excitement, and fun. After the skit, Parichay-The Fresher’s Party, is organized. A theme is adorned by freshers for the party and performances are lined up by them. All seniors and alumni are cordially invited to the event to welcome juniors in the DUCS family.

Farewell Party: The students bid adieu to all the final-year seniors with great ostentation at this party. Performances, goodbye speeches, titles & souvenirs and the farewell video made by juniors showcasing their journey at DUCS all form the perfect ingredients for a nostalgic yet memorable recipe of lives at DUCS.

Festivals :

DUCS are family to each other. Following festivals are celebrated with great zeal and vigour :

Teacher’s Day : It is important that not only students but our teachers receive a warm environment of appreciation and honour. Hence, students organise a small celebration for thanking the teachers for all the guidance they have provided us with. 

Diwali : Every year, seniors and juniors dressed in ethnics gather together to celebrate Diwali. Students make Rangoli, and perform Laxmi Pooja which is followed by DJ session. Lamps and Candles are lighten throughout the department.

Holi : The festival of colours is celebrated with vigour & smiles. Department is painted with colours and students and teachers gather to celebrate this festival together.

Sankalan :- Our tech fest !

Since its inception in 2005, every year DUCS organises its annual fest with much enthusiasm and energy. Students from various universities come and participate in this two day event. Renowned people from the IT industry and our alumni placed in various tech giant companies judge and review all the technical events held during the fest. 
After the two days long grilling experience, students are awarded and appreciated for winning and participating in the fest. 

This year , Sankalan has become more special. A new quiz portal has been developed from scratch for Sankalan using Laravel and Vue.js which handled everything from registration to evaluation.

Intra-Sankalan : 

The DUCS Society also conducts INTRA-SANKALAN, where the students of the Department compete among themselves in many technical and non-technical events.

DUCS Coding Club :

DUCS is an active body which runs on the principle of building and developing perceptive brains. Everyone helps each other to learn the new trends and technologies. 

Together this year, the club was able to make some of the best achievements, which include:

More than 30 students got a HacktoberFest 18 shirt for creating pull request and contributing to tech society by Digital Ocean.
About 50 students were able to learn the Amazon Alexa technology and created their own skills which are now live on Alexa Skill Store.
Two students received Facebook-Udacity PyTorch Scholarship Challenge.

Students under this umbrella have learned a lot through exploration and experience. Together, students attend sessions at various places. Not only outside, but students conduct sessions amongst themselves and in their colleges to grow everyone around them.
