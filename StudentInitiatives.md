## Student Initiatives

Srijan : The Student Magazine 

“Srijan” as the name suggest; is the creation of a doorway letting everyone express views on a wide array of technical as well as non-technical topics. The magazine encourages students to think beyond the pages of the textbook and brings out their creative side.


Student Orientation : The Welcome and The GoodBye ! 

Amidst a plethora of projects & assignments we do ensure to have a break for celebrating and interacting with each other. Besides the day to day, luncheons, birthday celebrations; DUCS has a culture of celebrating these three fun get-togethers :

Orientation : The Department teachers and students organize an orientation on the first day of the academic year, to enlighten the new students about the rules and regulations of the department. The orientation ensures that the best of knowledge is provided to all students to carry out their life at the department with ease.

Skit and Freshers: The skit is a welcoming fun event to carve out the actor within each one of us. This event fills the air with humor, excitement, and fun. After the skit, Parichay-The Fresher’s Party, is organized. A theme is adorned by freshers for the party and performances are lined up by them. All seniors and alumni are cordially invited to the event to welcome juniors in the DUCS family.

Farewell Party: The students bid adieu to all the final-year seniors with great ostentation at this party. Performances, goodbye speeches, titles & souvenirs and the farewell video made by juniors showcasing their journey at DUCS all form the perfect ingredients for a nostalgic yet memorable recipe of lives at DUCS.

Festivals :

DUCS are family to each other. Following festivals are celebrated with great zeal and vigour :

Teacher’s Day : It is important that not only students but our teachers receive a warm environment of appreciation and honour. Hence, students organise a small celebration for thanking the teachers for all the guidance they have provided us with. 

Diwali : Every year, seniors and juniors dressed in ethnics gather together to celebrate Diwali. Students make Rangoli, and perform Laxmi Pooja which is followed by DJ session. Lamps and Candles are lighten throughout the department.

Holi : The festival of colours is celebrated with vigour & smiles. Department is painted with colours and students and teachers gather to celebrate this festival together.
