##DELHI UNIVERSITY COMPUTER SCIENCE SOCIETY
<br/>

The Department creates an environment for students to take up challenging tasks; bring forth their latent capabilities; discover their full potential, and hence enhances this little yet significant Tech-Community that we have here.
In order to achieve this goal, a number of activities are organized for students to help them build the traits of teamwork, trustworthiness, and synchronization.
Established in 2005, Delhi University Computer Science Society aims to “build better student-industry interface” by conducting various seminars, conferences, and technical fests and thereby helps in narrowing down the gap between education and industrial demands.
Since 2005 every year, the Society organizes SANKALAN, a two-day technical fest which brings out the technology as well as a creative spark of the students.
