Department of Computer Science was established at the University of Delhi, in the year 1981, with the objective of imparting quality education in the field of Computer Science. With rapidly evolving technology and continuous need for innovation, the department has been producing quality professionals, holding important positions in the Information Technology industry both in India and abroad.
The Department started Master of Computer Applications (MCA) programme in the year 1982, which was among the first such programmes in India. The MCA programme focuses on providing a sound theoretical background as well as good practical exposure to students in the relevant areas. It is intended to provide a modern, industry-oriented education in applied computer science. It aims at producing trained professionals who can successfuIly meet the demands of the IT industry.They obtain skills and experience in up-to-date approaches to analysis, design, implementation, validation, and documentation of computer software and hardware.
The Department started M.Sc. Computer Science course in the year 2004 with the aim to develop core competence in Computer Science and to prepare the students to take up challenges of research and development. The students have the ability to apply a high level of theoretical expertise and innovation to complex problems and application of new technologies. M.Sc. has been designed to teach the mathematical principles of specification, design and efficient implementation of both software and hardware.
The Department also offers Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) programme aimed at producing quality researchers in several diverse branches of Computer Science.
Apart from these, the Department coordinates B.Sc. (H) Computer Science, B.Sc. Physical Science (Computer Science) and other courses taught at constituent colleges of University of Delhi.
