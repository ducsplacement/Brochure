The Department of Computer Science, University of Delhi, runs two postgraduate courses namely Master of Computer Applications (MCA) & M.Sc. Computer Science and prepares the students for a bright future. Emphasis is laid on the theoretical concepts as well as on practical experience and industry interaction.
I am pleased that the Department of Computer Science has been successfully bringing out a placement brochure to facilitate campus recruitment of their students.
I am sure that many bright and enthusiastic students will continue to join these courses. My best wishes for this initiative at our university.
